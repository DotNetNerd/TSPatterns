TSPatterns
==========

**TSPatterns** is a collection of patterns for use with TypeScript. 

Single Page Application frameworks have become all the rage these last years, which has lead to issues now that the frameworks no longer remain backward compatible. 
The tail has been wagging the dog long enough, because as it turnes out, we don't really need a big monolithic framework. 
This is a call to get back to good practices and instead build more maintainable applications using well known patterns, and smaller libraries, that can easilly be updated or switched out. 

There are loads of nice simple 200-300 LOC libraries out there, so the missing piece is a bit of application architecture. TypeScript is a good fit for implementing such patterns, without getting lost in module patterns etc.
This project contains sample implementations of those patterns. Notice the word **sample** - they are meant to be ~~bastardised~~ changed as needed.
